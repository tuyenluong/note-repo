As we know, nouns are naming words and verbs are doing words. They are the most important words in a sentence. 

When we study English grammar, we should learn nouns and verbs first. A noun has several types, like proper, common, countable, uncountable, etc.; while verbs can be classified as transitive and intransitive.

When we use a sentences, we often occur a pattern of Noun + Verb like the following examples:
- *Thomas wrote a letter to his boss.*
- *Lisa studied hard for her exam.*

In the examples, above, the proper nouns **Thomas** and **Lisa** are subjects and they are followed by the verbs **wrote** and **studied** respectively.

S (*Subjects is a Noun*) + V (*Verb*) = Noun + Verb pattern.

Some cases in Noun + Verb pattern, a Verb can add s/es when the Subjects is plural. 

You can tell if it's plural or not in this article [[ENG - Singular and plural]]

It is important to note that sentences in simple tenses (past simple and present simple tenses) follow Noun + Verb pattern.

-   _A lion roars._
-   _A bird sings._
-   _My teacher taught me how to write a formal letter._
-   _His doctor advised him to rest for a week._

- Just for to be verb only.
	- If the subject is singular nouns then verb must be added s/es   (E.g. A firefighter NEEDs water to put out the fire. | She goes to work at 6 in the morning every day. | My dog LIKEs carrots, pears and bread.)
	- If the subject are plural nouns then verb stay the same. (E.g. Students in my school are rich kids. | Their parents are moguls. | Most of my friends have their own motorbikes.)
