<h2>When we use A or AN?</h2>

*A, An* and *the* are articles. We use *A* before consonant sound *(b, d, k, t, s, c, etc)*: *a cafe, a tourist, a museum*
* AND before *u* or *eu* when they sound like *you*: ***a u**niform*, ***a Eu**ropen city*

We use *an* before <u>vowels</u> *(a, e, i, o, u)*: *an* interesting book, ***an u**nusual job* 
- AND before words that begin with a silent *h*: ***an h**our* 

We pronounce *the* with /ə/ before the <u>consonant</u> sounds: *the book, the tourist* -> (Cách phát âm: tơ)
And before <u>vowels</u> sounds we pronounce *the* with /i:/: *the art gallary, the English teacher* -> (Cách phát âm: thee)
