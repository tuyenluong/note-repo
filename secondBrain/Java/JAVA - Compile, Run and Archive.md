- Compile
	- Compiling code with packages
		- Declaring class path for Java class on different OS: 
			- First class:
				- C:\\com\\udemy\\ocppackage\Ocp.java (*Windows*)
				- \/com\/udemy\/ocppackage\/Ocp.java (*Unix*)
			- Second class: 
				- C:\\com\\udemy\\ocapackage\Oca.java (*Windows*)
				- \/com\/udemy\/ocapackage\/Oca.java (*Unix*)
			- Take the common-ground position:
				- cd C:\\com\\udemy\\ (*Windows*)
				- cd  \/com\/udemy (*Unix*)
	- [[JAVA - main() method#^33c6b8|Compiling note for prior Java 11]]
		- javac ocppackage/Ocp.java ocapackage/Oca.java
			- output: .class files
	- Alternatively, you can compile multiple Java files in one package at once using wild cards sign (*\**)
		- javac ocppackage/\*.java ocapackage/\*.java
- Run
	- Run Ocp application
		- java ocppackage.Ocp
	- What if we want classes in another directory?
		- java -d classes ocppackage/Ocp.java ocapackage/Oca.java
			- The -d \<directory\> is specify a directory to interact with if required
	- Three ways to run Ocp application:
		- java -cp classes ecpackage.Ocp
		- java -classpath classes ecpackage.Ocp
		- java --class-path classes ecpackage.Ocp
			- \<classpath\>  option can be used with javac command to specify location of classes needed to compile the program.
	- And If we have a application that depends on other files to run, like some of the files are in package "deps", and some are in myJar.jar then we will have a syntax like this.
		- java -cp ".;C:\comudemy\deps;C:\comudemy\myJar.jar" myPackage.myApp
		- The dot is including the current folder, next is the "deps" package that will be separated by a semi colon. And the last one is a jar file.
		- You also can use the wildcards sign for many jar files as well.
- Archive
	-  Create your own jar file
		- [Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/view.html).
		- jar -cvf \<yourNewJarFileName\>.jar . 
		- jar -cvf stand for --create --verbose --file 
		- The dot at the and is your current directory or you can specify the custom folder to be archive
		- jar -cvf \<yourNewJarFileName\>.jar  \<yourCustomFolderToBeArchive\>

## Flash cards section

What command to creates a jar file of desired project with the Java command?;; jar -cvf \<yourNewJarFileName\>.jar .
<!--SR:!2024-08-04,2,190-->

How can you choose which folder to be archive with the jar command?
?
By identifying the custom folder to be archive after you defined your jar file name
jar -cvf \<yourNewJarFileName\>.jar  \<yourCustomFolderToBeArchive\>
<!--SR:!2024-08-04,2,192--> 

What is the common-ground position for compiling Java classes with packages on Windows and Unix? ;; Windows: `cd C:\\com\\udemy\\`; Unix: `cd /com/udemy`

How do you declare the class path for a Java class on Windows? ;; Example: `C:\\com\\udemy\\ocppackage\\Ocp.java`

How do you declare the class path for a Java class on Unix? ;; Example: `/com/udemy/ocppackage/Ocp.java`

What command do you use to compile multiple Java files in different packages at once? ;; `javac ocppackage/*.java ocapackage/*.java`

How do you run a Java application from the `ocppackage` package? ;; `java ocppackage.Ocp`

How do you specify a directory to store compiled class files when compiling? ;; `java -d classes ocppackage/Ocp.java ocapackage/Oca.java`

What command can you use to run a Java application with classes located in a different directory? ;; `java -cp classes ocppackage.Ocp`, `java -classpath classes ocppackage.Ocp`, or `java --class-path classes ocppackage.Ocp`

ow do you specify the classpath when a Java application depends on other files in different packages and jars? ;; `java -cp ".;C:\comudemy\deps;C:\comudemy\myJar.jar" myPackage.myApp`

What does the dot (.) represent in the classpath declaration? ;; It includes the current folder.

How can you use wildcards in the classpath declaration? ;; Wildcards can be used to include multiple jar files, for example: `java -cp ".;C:\comudemy\deps;C:\comudemy\*.jar" myPackage.myApp`

What is the command to create your own jar file? ;; `jar -cvf <yourNewJarFileName>.jar .`

What do the flags `-cvf` stand for in the jar command? ;; `-c` stands for create, `-v` stands for verbose, `-f` stands for file.

What does the dot (.) signify in the jar command `jar -cvf <yourNewJarFileName>.jar .`? ;; It represents the current directory.
<!--SR:!2024-08-05,3,253-->

How can you specify a custom folder to be archived into a jar file? ;; Use `jar -cvf <yourNewJarFileName>.jar <yourCustomFolderToBeArchive>`

What command would you use to compile the classes `Ocp.java` and `Oca.java`? ;; `javac ocppackage/Ocp.java ocapackage/Oca.java`
