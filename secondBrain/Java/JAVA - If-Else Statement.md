## The Syntax of If/Else statement

```java
if(expression1){
  // block of code 1
}else if(expression2){
  // block of code 2
}else if(expression3){
  // block of code 3
}else{
  // block of code 4
}
```

- Argument is `boolean` expression
- Block evaluates if expression is `true` 
	- `else-if` block is optional
	- But the `else-if` block can be as many as you want
- `else` block is also optional
	- but the `else` block just can be one only 
	- and the `else` block only exist only the `if` block present
- If there is only one command in the block, you can omit the curly bracket.
