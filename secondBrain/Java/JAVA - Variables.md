## Variables (terminology)

- **Variable** is a name for a piece of memory which stores data
- To **declare a variable** means to state variable type and give it a name
```java
int x;
```
- To **initialize a variable** means to give a variable a value
```java
int x = 5;
```

- Name of the variable (method, class, interface, package...) is called **identifier**.
## Identifier rules

- Must begin with a letter, currency symbol or underscore 
```java
int first;
int $first;
int _first;
```
- Can include numbers, but **NOT** start with a number.
```java
int 1first; ==>> NOT OK
int first1; ==>> OK
int f1rst; ==>> OK
```
- Single underscore is not allowed as an identifier
```java
int _; ==>> NOT OK
```
- You cannot use the reserved word from Java. ^4706f6
	- These are the words that commonly used in Java, so you don't need to remember all of them.
	- ![[Pasted image 20240224140020.png]]

## Naming conventions

- For variables, use **camelCase**
- For constants, use **SNAKE_CASE**
- Identifiers of classes, interfaces, enums records start with first uppercase letter. Example:
	- MyClass
	- MyInterface
	- StudentRecord
- Identifiers variables and methods start with first lower letter. Example:
	- fullName
	- getFullName()
### JAVA IDENTIFIERS ARE CASE SENSITIVE !!
- Which means if you have two different variables with the same name and different uppercase and lowercase, Java will treated it as two different variables.
```java
int firstOrder; ==>> Two different variables
int firstORDER; ==>>
```
- Multiple variables can be declare and/or initialized in a single command.
- This is ok as long as all the variables is the same data type.
```java
==>> Bad practice, but it compiles
int x, y; 
String firstName = "John", lastName = "Wayne";
boolean v = true, w, z = false;
```
- But you cannot declare two variables with different data types in a single command. ^7254a8
```java
int x, String name; ==>> DOES NOT COMPILE
```
- What I means when I said "In a single command" not "in a single line"?
	- A single command is when a line a code end with a semi colon sign. [[JAVA - Variables#^0220b8|Example]]
	- And a singe line is just a line in the file.
	- And [[JAVA - Variables#^7254a8|"the two different data types in a single command"]] also [[JAVA - Variables#^1ada98|applied in this situation.]] 
```java
1| int x,  ==>> line 1, single line
2|     v;  ==>> command, single command
```
^0220b8
```java
1| int x,            
2|     String name;  ==>> DOES NOT COMPILE
```
^1ada98
## Three kinds of variables

1. [[JAVA - Class Structure#^57453a|Local variables]] - exist only within the block of code { ... }
2. [[JAVA - Class Structure#^320288|Instance variables (fields)]] -  defined within the specific instance of the object.
3. [[JAVA - Class Structure#^4f6c63|Class variables]] - belong to a class and is shared with all instances of the class.

- Local variables must be initialized before use !!
```java
public int doesNotCompile(){
	int a = 5;
	int b;
	return a + b; ==>> You are trying to use uninitialized variable b, so it won't compile
}
```

```java
public int doesCompile(){
	int a = 5, b = 3;
	int c;
	return a + b; ==>> c is not initialized, but it's never used, to this code compiles
}
```

- Be careful if initialization is within if-statement
```java
public void doesNotCompile(boolean isOk){
	int a;
	if (isOk){
		a = 5; ==>> Might never be reached
	}
	System.out.println(a); ==>> so this will not compile
}
```
```java
public void doesCompile(boolean isOk){
	int a;
	if (isOk){ ==>> Cause a will initialized one way or another.
		a = 5; 
	}else{
		a = 2;
	}
	System.out.println(a); ==>> so this will compile
}
```

- Final variables (constants)
	- Also called as constants
	- When a variable became constants is when you using keyword "final"
	- And once you assign a variable as final, you cannot change the value in the further course of the programs.
	- That's why it's used for constants.
	- If you try to change the final variable, you will get a error.

```java
final int MAX_HEIGHT = 100;
```

- Final can be applied to a reference:
```java
final int[] MY_NUMBERS = new int[5];
```

- Reference cannot be modified, but the **CONTENT OF THE OBJECT CAN**
```java
final int[] MY_NUMBERS = new int[5];
MY_NUMBERS[2] = 13; ==>> OK
MY_NUMBERS = null; ==>> DOES NOT COMPILE
```

## Variable scope

- Variables can go out of scope (cease to exist)

1. [[JAVA - Class Structure#^57453a|Local variables]]: in scope from { to }.
2. [[JAVA - Class Structure#^e7f712|Method parameters]]: in scope for the duration of the method.
3. [[JAVA - Class Structure#^320288|Instance variables (fields)]]: in scope from declaration until the object is eligible for garbage collector.
4. [[JAVA - Class Structure#^4f6c63|Class variables]] : in scope from declaration until the program ends.

- Scope example:
```java
if(isOk){
	int x = 5;
	System.out.println(x) ==>> OK
}
System.out.println(x) ==>> DOES NOT COMPILE
					==>> x is out of scope
```

## Flash cards section

**What is a variable in Java?** ;; A variable is a name for a piece of memory that stores data.

**What is the difference between declaring and initializing a variable?** ;; Declaring a variable means stating its type and name (e.g., `int x;`), while initializing a variable means assigning it a value (e.g., `int x = 5;`).

**What is an identifier in Java?** ;; An identifier is the name used for a variable, method, class, interface, or package.

**What are the rules for naming an identifier in Java?** ;; An identifier must begin with a letter, currency symbol, or underscore, and it can include numbers but cannot start with a number. Single underscores alone are not allowed, and reserved words cannot be used.

**What are the Java naming conventions for variables and constants?** ;; Variables use camelCase (e.g., `fullName`), and constants use SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_HEIGHT`). Classes, interfaces, and enums use PascalCase (e.g., `MyClass`).

**Are Java identifiers case-sensitive?** ;; Yes, Java identifiers are case-sensitive, meaning `firstOrder` and `firstORDER` would be treated as different variables.

**True or False: You can declare and initialize variables of different types in a single command.** ;; False. You can only declare and initialize variables of the same type in a single command.

**True or False: The `final` keyword applied to a variable means the variableâ€™s value can be changed later.** ;; False. The `final` keyword means that the variable's value cannot be changed once assigned.

**True or False: An identifier in Java can start with a number as long as it is followed by letters or underscores.** ;; False. An identifier cannot start with a number.

**True or False: A local variable must be initialized before use.** ;; True. Local variables must be initialized before they are used in a method.

**True or False: The following code will compile successfully: `int _;`** ;; False. While underscores are allowed as part of an identifier, a single underscore alone is not a valid identifier in Java.

What will this code print?
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int y = 20;
        System.out.println(x + " " + y);
    }
}
```
?
The output will be `10 20`.

What will happen if you try to compile this code?
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x, String name;
    }
}
```
?
The code will not compile because you cannot declare variables of different data types in a single command.

What will this code do?
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        if (x > 0) {
            int y = 10;
            System.out.println(y);
        }
        System.out.println(y);
    }
}
```
?
The code will not compile because `y` is out of scope when accessed outside the `if` block.

What is the output of this code?
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int MAX_HEIGHT = 100;
        System.out.println(MAX_HEIGHT);
    }
}
```
?
The output will be `100`.

What will happen if you try to compile this code?
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final int[] MY_NUMBERS = new int[5];
        MY_NUMBERS[2] = 13; // This is OK
        MY_NUMBERS = null; // This will cause a compile error
    }
}
```
?
The code will compile successfully for `MY_NUMBERS[2] = 13;` but will not compile for `MY_NUMBERS = null;` because `MY_NUMBERS` is a final reference.
