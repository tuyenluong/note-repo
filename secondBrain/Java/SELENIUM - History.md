    - **Support for Multiple Browsers**: WebDriver supported multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and others.
    - **Improved Performance**: WebDriver's direct browser interactions made it faster and more reliable than Selenium RC, which relied on JavaScript for automation.
    - **Native Browser Interactions**: Provided the ability to interact with browser elements in a more native way, improving compatibility with modern web applications.

## Selenium 3.0

    - **Fully W3C Compliant**: Selenium 4.0 is fully compliant with the W3C WebDriver standard, ensuring a standardized and interoperable way to automate web browsers.
    - **New Browser DevTools Protocols**: Added support for Chrome DevTools and Edge DevTools protocols, allowing for deeper browser interactions such as network interception, capturing performance metrics, and debugging.
    - **Improved Grid**: A revamped Selenium Grid with support for Docker, improved scaling, and easier setup.
    - **Relative Locators**: Introduced relative locators (e.g., find elements near, to the left of, above, below other elements) to simplify locating elements on a page.
    - **Better Documentation and IDE**: Enhanced documentation and a new Selenium IDE for easier creation and management of test scripts.
    - **WebDriver BiDi**: Introduced initial support for bidirectional communication with the browser, enabling more interactive automation scenarios.
