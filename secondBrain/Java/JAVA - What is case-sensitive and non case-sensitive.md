In computer program, when a particular function or program is case-sensitive then it can recognize if a letter is a capital or a small letter.
And vice-versa for non case-sensitive.

How does a case-sensitive programming environment handle identifiers that differ only in capitalization? ;; In a case-sensitive environment, identifiers that differ only in capitalization are treated as distinct entities.
<!--SR:!2024-05-06,1,226-->
In a non-case-sensitive programming language, what is the behaviour when comparing strings like "Word" and "word"? ;; In a non-case-sensitive language, the comparison of "Word" and "word" would yield a true result as the comparison ignores case differences.
What impact does case sensitivity have on variable names in programming languages? ;; In a case-sensitive language, variable names must match exactly in terms of capitalization to refer to the same variable, while in a non-case-sensitive language, capitalization does not matter.
<!--SR:!2024-07-16,2,206-->
When writing code in a case-sensitive environment, what consideration should be given to function names and keywords? ;; In a case-sensitive environment, function names and keywords must be written with consistent capitalization as per their definitions, otherwise, the code may result in errors or unexpected behaviour.
<!--SR:!2024-07-10,1,216-->
How would a case-sensitive file system handle requests to access files named "Document.txt" and "document.txt"? ;; In a case-sensitive file system, "Document.txt" and "document.txt" would be treated as distinct files, and attempts to access one using the other's name would result in a file not found error.
<!--SR:!2024-07-15,1,210-->
Explain the behaviour of a case-insensitive programming language when comparing characters or strings. ;; In a case-insensitive language, character or string comparisons are performed without regard to case differences, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.
<!--SR:!2024-07-15,1,206-->
What challenges might arise when porting code from a case-insensitive to a case-sensitive environment? ;; When porting code from a case-insensitive to a case-sensitive environment, developers need to ensure that all identifiers, including variables, functions, and keywords, are used with consistent capitalization to avoid errors.
How can the choice between case-sensitive and non-case-sensitive programming languages impact code readability and maintainability? ;; The choice between case-sensitive and non-case-sensitive languages can impact code readability and maintainability by affecting naming conventions and the ease of understanding code for developers.
<!--SR:!2024-07-15,1,190-->
What is the significance of case sensitivity in database queries, especially in SQL? ;; In SQL, case sensitivity can affect the correctness of database queries, as keywords and identifiers may need to match exactly in terms of capitalization to be recognized by the database engine.
<!--SR:!2024-07-11,1,197-->
When working in a case-sensitive programming environment, why is it important for developers to pay attention to the capitalization of identifiers? ;; In a case-sensitive environment, paying attention to the capitalization of identifiers is crucial to ensure that variables, functions, and keywords are correctly recognized and used throughout the codebase.
