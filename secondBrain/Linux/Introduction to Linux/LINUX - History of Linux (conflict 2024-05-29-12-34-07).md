## Growth and Evolution:
-  Early 1990s: Linux rapidly evolved through collaboration over the internet (*Slackware and Debian*)
- 1994: Linux 1.0 was released with 176k lines of code
- Late 1990s: Commercial interest in Linux grew (*Red Hat and SUSE*)
- 2000s: Linus saw significant adoption in server markets.
- In 2007, Google released the Android OS for mobile devices which based on Linus kernel, this gave Linus enormous boost in the mobile market. 

## Today
- Linux has grown from a hobbyist's project into a powerful force in computing, powering everything from the mobile devices, personal computers, and servers to mainframes and supercomputers.
