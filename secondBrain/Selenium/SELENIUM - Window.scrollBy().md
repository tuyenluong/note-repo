The JavaScript code `window.scrollBy(0, -200);` is used to scroll the current window **upwards** by 200 pixels. Here’s a breakdown of what each part of the function does:

- `window`: This refers to the current browser window.
- `scrollBy()`: This method scrolls the document in the window by the specified number of pixels.
- `(0, -200)`: These are the parameters passed to the `scrollBy()` method. The first parameter (`0`) is the horizontal scroll amount, and the second parameter (`-200`) is the vertical scroll amount. A positive value would scroll down, while a negative value scrolls up.

[So, in essence, this line of code moves the view of the webpage up by 200 pixels, which could be useful for adjusting the view after an action, like closing a modal or overlay](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_scrollby.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_scrollby.asp)[2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/scrollBy). If you want to see this in action, you could run this line of code in your browser’s console on a page that is scrollable.
