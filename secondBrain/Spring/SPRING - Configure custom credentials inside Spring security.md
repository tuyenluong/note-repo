- You can use `spring.security.user.name` and `spring.security.user.password` key to define the credential inside your Spring `application.properties` file
- But realistically, when you building an application, there will be hundred and million user account. Therefore it's not practical to setup credential in this way.
- We only use this approach to to POC (*Prof of concept*) and mock account for testing only, not in production.
