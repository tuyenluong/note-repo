_@Component_ is an annotation that allows Spring to detect our custom beans automatically.

In other words, without having to write any explicit code, Spring will:

- Scan our application for classes annotated with _@Component_
- Instantiate them and inject any specified dependencies into them
- Inject them wherever needed

However, most developers prefer to use more specialized stereotype annotations to serve this function.
