* We can based on the nouns ending in which charecters below to add *-es* plural form:
	* -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -o, -x and -z.
* We add *-ies* plural form for nouns eding with *-y*
	* Example: coun***try*** -> countr***ies***.
* Add *-ves* plural form for nouns ending with *-f* or *-fe*
	* Example: li***fe*** -> li***ves***, thie***f*** -> thie***ves***
