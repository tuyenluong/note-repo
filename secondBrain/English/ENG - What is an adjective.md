### What Is an adjective?

The [most simple definition](https://writingcenter.uagc.edu/adjectives) is: an adjective describes a noun. Concerning function, adjectives can be defined as information gatherers. **More specifically, they collect information based on an object's shape, size, color, age/number, origin, or material.**

Some example sentences with adjectives:
- It’s a **big** cat.
- It’s a **black** cat.
- It’s an **old** cat.
Adjectives can also answer questions such as “How many, which ones, or what kind?”
