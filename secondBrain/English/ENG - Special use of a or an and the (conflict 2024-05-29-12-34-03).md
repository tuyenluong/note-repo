<h2>Jobs and descriptions</h2>
- We use A/AN with the names of jobs.
- We also ise A/AN to descipre a person or thing, usually with an adjective.

<h2>Institutions: purpose or building?</h2>
* Insitutions: school, college, university, prison, hospital

When we think of the purpose of this <u>intitutions</u> we don't use *the*.
But when we think about <u>building</u>, we use *the* or *a/an*.
<h2>The media</h2>
We use *the* with names of most newspapers, but most magazines have no article:

| **Type of media**  |                |          |                    |       |
| ------------------ | -------------- | -------- | ------------------ | ----- |
| **most magazines** | the Daily News | the Sun  | the New York Times |       |
| **newspapers**     | Vogue          | Newsweek | Time               | Hello |

We say <u>the cinema, the theatre</u> and <u>the radio</u>, but we don't usually use *the* with *television* or *TV* when we talk about programmes.

We use *a* or *the* if we talking about the machine.
<h2> <u>the</u> + adjective for groups and nationalities</h2>
| The groups   |                |             |          |             |          |              |   
| ------------ | -------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------ | 
| the young    | the old        | the elderly | the rich | the poor    | the sick | the homeless |     |     |     |     |     |
| the disabled | the unemployed | the blind   | the deaf | the injured | the dead |              |     |     |     |     |     |

Some adjectives can be used as nouns if they describe a particular group, all the people who are rich = the rich.

We use a plural verb:
- The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.

We can use nationality adjectives that end in *-ch/-sh/-ese* in the same way,
e.g. French, Spanish, Dutch, Japanese.
- The French have elected a new president. (all the French people)
- The Irish are voting on the new European Union tomorrow. (all the Irish people)

We can't use other nationality words in this way: 
- X The Brazilian are used to hot weather. 
- ✔ Brazilians are used to hot weather.
