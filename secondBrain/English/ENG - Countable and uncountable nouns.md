Sometimes we will came across several topics/subjects that we cannot count. Uncountable nouns are things we can't count:
* food and drink: *bread, butter, meat, tea, coffee, milk, oil, pasta, salt, rice*
* materials: *water, oli, air, oxygen, metal, cotton, wood, plastic, paper*
* school subject and languages: *geography, art, music, English, Spanish*
* ideas and feelings: *education, work, advice, beauty, love, knowledge, fun*
* activities: *shopping, cycling, swimming*  
* groups of similar things: *furniture, luggage, money*

Characteristic of the Countable and Uncountable nouns:
