Validation is key for application to prevent corrupted data snuck into our system. Therefore it's essential to have data validation step when user make an input.

But there is a question is "Validation should be done on Front or Back end"?

The answer is both.

While frontend validation is also possible but it easily get bypass by the end user through the console or through the DOM. It should only be used to improve the "user experience" - by providing instant feedback such as make sure the input is required. It also reduces the load on the server.

Back-end validation is a MUST. It has to ensure that the data coming in is indeed valid data, data integrity and consistency
