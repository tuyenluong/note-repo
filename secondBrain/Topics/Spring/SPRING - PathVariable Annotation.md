The @PathVariable annotation is used to extract value from the URI, It is most suitable for the RESTful web service where the URL contains some value. Spring MVC allows us to use multiple @PathVariable annotations in the same method.

For example, if we want to get the value from the requested URI path, then we use the @PathVariable annotation like in example below:

```text
http://localhost:8080/holidays/all
http://localhost:8080/holidays/festival
http://localhost:8080/holidays/federal
```
