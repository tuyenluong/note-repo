**Adverbs** commonly describe [verbs](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/verbs/). They add details to show how an action is done, as with the adverbs _quickly_ or _slowly_, or the frequency of the action, as with the adverbs _often_ or _sometimes_.

- She worked **quietly** all afternoon. 
- He **always** showers after the gym.

Additionally, special adverbs like _really_ or _very_ can also describe other adverbs. When adverbs are used like this, they usually describe the degree of intensity or frequency. 

- She worked **very** quietly all afternoon.

Likewise, adverbs can also describe adjectives, again typically specifying the degree of intensity or frequency.
