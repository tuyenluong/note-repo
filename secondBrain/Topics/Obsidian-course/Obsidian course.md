Act as a YouTube influencer, can you help me to generate a script based on this title: "How to copy plugins to new vault in obsidian" and the thumbnail? 
It should have an opening and ending hook. 
Add these attributes into my script and estimate it afterward: "include pauses, animations, transitions, examples, show live demonstrations, or engage with your audience through storytelling!"
But before you create the script, do you have knowledge about these plugins? If yes then continue, if no then say no then I'll provide you some information.
Here are the agenda:
1. Where the plugins stored? How do we locates it?
2. After you locates the correct plugin folder, what happen next? What we need to do? What we have notice?
3. What about core plugins?
