## What is a File system?

It is a system used by an operating system manage files. The system controls how data is saved or retrieved.

Operating system stores files and directories in an organized and structured way
- System configuration file = Folder A
- User files = Folder B
- Log files = Folder C
- Commands or scripts = Folder D and so on

There are many different type of filesystems. In general, improvements have been made to filesystem with new releases of operating systems and each new filesystem has been given a different name 
- e.g. `ext3`, `ext4`, `xfs`, `NTFS`, `FAT`, etc.
- And the Linux filesystem is : `ext3`, `ext4`, `xfs`
- Whereas `NTFS`, `FAT`, are the Windows file system
