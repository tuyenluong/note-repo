## What are command prompts?

- A command prompt, also referred to simply as a prompt, is a short text at the start of the command line followed by prompt symbol on a command line interface.

- In Linux: 
	- Command prompt format: `[<userName>@<hostName> ~] <promptSymbol>`
	- `[username@hostName ~] # `


## How to getting the prompt back

- Sometimes, when you typing a command but you not finished yet but accidentally hit `ENTER`, the prompt will get stuck and you unable to type anything else. Except for close the Command Prompt windows and start again.
- But none of us want to lose our working progress on the terminal or just don't want to lose all the log that you want to read it later.
- Then type `Ctrl + C` to get the prompt back, it will escape the last command and et the prompt back.
