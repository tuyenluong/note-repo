## Access to Linux System

There are 2 types access to the operating system:
1. Console
2. Remote

## Console access

The console is a direct access to an operating system when it is connected through VGA, HDMO, DVI etc.

## Remote access

The second type of the access type is remote where you connect to your operating system

- Windows have **Remote Desktop Connection**
- MAC have **Sharing**
- Remote to a Linux from a Windows, we have **Putty**

## But, importantly...

- Windows 10 or newer version already have SSH client built-in.
- Simply go to the Command Prompt and type in SSH to see all available commands
- For the precondition that if you know the IP address of your Linux machine all you have to do is type it in the Command Prompt
	-  `ssh <ip-address-of-your-linux-machine>`
- This also applied for MAC machine as well.
