Testing, as a form of quality control, helps in achieving the agreed upon goals within the set scope, time, quality, and budget constraints. Testing's contribution to success should not be restricted to the test team activities. Any stakeholder can use their testing skills to bring the project closer to success. Testing components, systems, and associated documentation helps to identify defects in software.  

Testing's contributions to success

Testing provides a cost-effective means of detecting defects. these defects can then be removed, so testing indirectly contributes to higher quality test objects.

Testing provides users with indirect representation on the development project. Testers ensure that their understanding of user's needs are considered throughout the development lifecycle. The alternative is to involve a representative set of users as part of the development project, which is not usually possible due to the high costs and lack of availability of suitable users. 

Testing may also be required to meet contractual or legal requirements, or to comply with regulatory standards.
