Order of initialization:
- If there is a super class, it's initialized first
- Then this follow:
![[JAVA - Objects#^dff309]]

This all happens at most once for each class!

Note that every class is initialized automatically if `main()` method is inside the class, or manually by calling `new MyClass();`.
