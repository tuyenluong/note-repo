## A class is not an object

**A class is a blueprint for an object**. it tells the virtual machine *how* to make an object of that particular type. Each object make from that class can have its own values for the instance variables of that class. For example, you might use the Button class to make dozens of different buttons, and each button might have its own color, size, shape, label and so on.
