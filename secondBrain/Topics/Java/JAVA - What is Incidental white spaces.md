[[ENG - incident whitespace|Incidental white spaces]] refer to the spaces that are not intentionally added to [[ENG - convey|convey]] a specific layout or format in content but occur as a by-product of coding, formatting, or data entry practices.

In Java, incidental whitespace refers to the extra spaces that are added unintentionally, such as when copying text from a source document or due to indentation in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to make the code easier to read. ^f00eea

These spaces are not intended to be a part of the string. On the other hand, essential whitespace is the whitespace that is intentionally written by the developer to be stored as a part of the string, such as in a string of properly indented HTML code.

Another source of incidental whitespace is copying text from a source document with unnecessarily added extra trailing spaces.
