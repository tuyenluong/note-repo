	- java: executes a program
	- jar: java archive (*packing files together)
	- javadoc: for documentation
	- jshell: java shell executional tool
- Java Runtime Environment (*JRE)
	- In Java 8 and earlier, this was a subset of JDK
	- JRE allows the user to run Java applications (*No compiler)
	- After Java 9, one just users full JDK to run Java applications
