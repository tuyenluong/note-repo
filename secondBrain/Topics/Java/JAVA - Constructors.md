## Constructors

- Special methods which are called every time you create an instance of an object.
- Name of the `contructor` must match the name of the class
- `constructor` don't have a return type
	- If the return type is stated, then it's just a normal method

## Constructor can be overloading

- `Constructor` can be [[JAVA - Overloading Methods|overloading]]

## If the class has no defined Constructor?

- If the class has no defined `constructor`, the default `constructor` is created
- The default `constructor` will be a no-argument `constructor`
- The default `constructor` will be called when don't have any argument pass into class when you make an instance of the class.
- The default `constructor` is created only if there are no other `constructor`is present

## Constructor access modifiers

- `constructor` are usually make public
	- but you can also make them `protected`, `default` or `private`
- `private` `constructor` are used if you don't want `public` no-argument `constructor`to be generated by the compiler
- In this case, the instance in usually created via some static method, and not using the keyword `new`
- We have seen this behaviour in classes used to create `Dates` and `Times`
`LocalDate = now = LocalDate.now();`
