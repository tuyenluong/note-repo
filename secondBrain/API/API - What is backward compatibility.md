Backward compatibility isÂ the ability of the new version of the API to work seamlessly with the previous version without breaking existing integrations. To ensure backward compatibility, consider the following best practices:

- Avoid removing or renaming existing API endpoints or fields: If an existing endpoint or field needs to be removed or renamed, consider keeping the old endpoint or field for a transition period or providing a new endpoint or field with the new name or functionality. This ensures that existing integrations continue to work without disruption.
- Avoid changing the data type or format of existing fields: If an existing field needs to change its data type or format, consider providing a new field with the new data type or format and keeping the old field for a transition period. This ensures that existing integrations continue to work without requiring significant changes.
- Document changes thoroughly: When making changes to the API, provide clear and comprehensive documentation that explains the changes and how they may impact existing integrations. This helps developers understand the changes and update their integrations accordingly.
- Use feature flags: Feature flags are a way of controlling access to new features or functionality in the API. By using feature flags, developers can enable or disable new features for specific integrations, allowing them to test and update their integrations before enabling the new features for all users.
