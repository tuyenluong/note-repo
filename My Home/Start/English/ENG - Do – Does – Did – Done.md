Do – Does – Did – Done it's auxiliary for a sentences.

- Do / Does in **questions**
	- We add **DO** at the beginning of the affirmative sentence to change it into a question. We use **Do** when the subject is **I**, **you**, **we** or **they**.
		- Affirmative: You speak Arabic.  
		- Question: **Do** you speak Arabic?
	- When the subject is **he**, **she** or **it**, we add **DOES** at the beginning to make the affirmative sentence a question. Notice that the letter **S** at the end of the verb in the affirmative sentence (because it is in third person) disappears in the question.
		- Affirmative: He speaks Arabic.  
		- Question: **Does** he speak Arabic?
		- NOTE: We **DON'T** use **Do** or **Does** in questions that have the verb **To Be** or **Modal Verbs** (can, must, might, should etc.)
	- Do / Does is a Simple Present Tense
- DID in **questions**
	- To make a question in the Past Tense in English we normally put the auxiliary **DID** at the beginning of the question or before the main subject.
	- **DID** is used with regular AND irregular verbs in English.
	- Both **Do and Does** in present tense questions become **Did** in past tense questions. Compare the following:
		- Present: **Do** they live in Spain?  
		- Past: **Did** they live in Spain?
- DON'T - DOESN'T - **[[ENG - Negative Sentences]]**
	- To make a negative sentence in English we normally use **Don't** or **Doesn't** in the **present sentence.**
	- You will see that we add **don't** between the subject and the verb. We use **Don't** when the subject is **I**, **you**, **we** or **they**.
		- Affirmative: You speak Spanish.  
		- Negative: You **don't** speak Spanish.
	- When the subject is **he**, **she** or **it**, we add **doesn't** between the subject and the verb to make a negative sentence.
		- Affirmative: He speaks Spanish.  
		- Negative: He **doesn't** speak Spanish.
- DIDN'T (DID NOT) - Negative Sentences
	- In the past tense **Didn't** is used to make a negative sentence for all subjects (I / you / we / they / he / she / it). This is for regular AND irregular verbs in English. (Exception is _To Be_ and Modal Verbs such as _Can_)
	- The main verb (_live_ in the example above) is in its base form (of the infinitive). The auxiliary _DIDN'T_ shows that the sentence is negative AND in the past tense.
		- Present: They **don't** live in Japan.  
		- Past: They **didn't** live in Japan.
- DO - For Emphasis
	- Sometimes _**Do / Does / Did**_ are used in **[[ENG - Positive sentences]]** to give special **emphasis**. Note that when speaking, the word (_do/does/did_) is stressed.
		- I **do** want to go. (We put stress on the word _DO_ to emphasize that we want to go)
		- You **do** need to take an umbrella.
		- He **does** like spinach. (You may be surprised but yes, he likes spinach)
		- I **did** study. (Contrary to what you may believe... yes, I studied)
	- Notice that _**Did**_ is used for positive sentences in the past tense and that the main verb is in its base form.
	- **_Do_** can also appear at the beginning of an imperative sentence to emphasize the importance of that imperative verb.
		- **Do** call when you arrive.
		- **Do** tell him that I will be waiting for him.
