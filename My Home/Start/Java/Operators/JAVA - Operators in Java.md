## There are three kinds of operators in java

- Unary operator
```java
a++;
```
- Binary operator
```java
a = b + c;
```
- Ternary operator
```java
a = (b > 0) ? 3 : 2
```


## Operator precedence

- Operator precedence means that some operators are executed before some others operators 
- And you've seen this in mathematics ([[JAVA - Operators in Java#^216732|Example:]]) or in some other programming languages.
	- In mathematics, the calculation with multiplication and division will be executed first
	- Along with the calculation within the parenthesis.

```java
a = 2 + (2*2) + (10/5) + 1
```
