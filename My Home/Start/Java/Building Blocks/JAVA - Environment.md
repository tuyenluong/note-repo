- If you're taking OCA then you need Java 8 or Java 17 if you're taking OCP 829
- Key commands provided by JDK (*Java Development Kit)
	- javac: converts .java souces files into .class **bytecode**
	- java: executes a program
	- jar: java archive (*packing files together)
	- javadoc: for documentation
- Java Runtime Environment (*JRE)
	- In Java 8 and earlier, this was a subset of JDK
	- JRE allows the user to run Java applications (*No compiler)
