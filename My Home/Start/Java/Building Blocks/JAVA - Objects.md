#Java 
#Done 

 - Creating objects
	 - [[JAVA - Class Structure#^a36269|Object is an instance of the class.]] (*Object = house, Class = blueprint*)
	 - New object is created using a keyword called *new*:
		 - [[JAVA - Objects#^77110b|Student s = new Student();]]
	 - When an object created, *the constructor* of the object is called
	 - The constructor like method, but <u>no return type.</u>
		 - Which means the constructor will not having the <u>void</u> return type as well.
		 - [[JAVA - Objects#^6f7319|This is an example of a valid constructor.]]
	- But [[JAVA - Objects#^5a7d1c|if a constructor added a return type]], then will it compile?
		- The answer is YES!! It will compile. But this time, it will be treated as a method, not a constructor anymore.
		- A valid constructor DO NOT have any return type, and the name of the constructor will be the same as the class name. The constructor naming is a convention to tell the different between a method and a constructor.
		- A [[JAVA - Objects#^5a7d1c|method naming convention]] is the first letter of the method name must be lowercase and must contains a return type or a void.
		- A [[JAVA - Objects#^6f7319|constructor naming convention]] is the constructor name must be identical as the class name and there will be no return type even a void.
	- If you don't provide any constructor, the compiler will generate [[JAVA - Objects#^2bbda1|a simple no-argument constructor]].
- Order of initialization
	- [[JAVA - Objects#^f93564|Static initialization blocks]] will run whenever the class is loaded first time in JVM, which means the static initialize block will run one time only when the class is initialize for the first time.
		- And it will run before any the constructor, data members and any initialization blocks.
	- [[JAVA - Objects#^4dbc9d|Initialization Blocks]] run in the same order in which they appear in the program.
		- [[JAVA - Objects#^a31683|If the data member placed before the Initialization block]] then the data member will run first.
		- On the other hands, [[JAVA - Objects#^33e48a|if the Initialization block is placed before the data member]], then it will run first.
	- And the [[JAVA - Objects#^4dbc9d|Initialization Blocks]] are executed whenever the class is initialized and before constructors are invoked. They are typically placed above the constructors within braces.
		- [[JAVA - Objects#^a4e19d|Example.]]

```java
Student s = new Student(); -->> new object is created and constructor is called.
```
^77110b

```java
public Student() { -->> this is a valid constructor.
	System.out.println("New student is created."); 
}
```
^6f7319

```java
public void Student() { -->> if the constructor added the return type??
	System.out.println("New student is created."); 
}
```
^5a7d1c

```java
public Student() { } -->> a simple no-argument constructor.
```
^2bbda1

```java
static  
{  
    System.out.println("1st static init");  
}
```
^f93564

```java
{
	System.out.println("1st instance init");
}
```
^4dbc9d

```java
{  
    System.out.println("2nd instance init");  -->> this will run first
}  
  
int j = 10; -->> run second
```
^a31683

```java
int j = 10; -->> this will run first
{  
    System.out.println("2nd instance init");  -->> run second
}  
```
^33e48a

```java
{  
    System.out.println("2nd instance init"); -->> this will run first
}
GFG(int x)
{
	System.out.println("ONE argument constructor"); -->> this will run after the Initializer Blocks
}
GFG()
{
	System.out.println("NoÂ  argument constructor"); -->> this will run after the Initializer Blocks
}
```
