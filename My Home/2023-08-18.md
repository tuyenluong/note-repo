Sure, I can help you with that. Here are 10 common problems and solutions for DIY interior design, as well as some profitable ideas based on popular decoration communities.

- Problem: Choosing the wrong paint color. 
	- Solution: Test the paint color on a small area of the wall before painting the whole room. Use a color wheel to find complementary or contrasting colors that match your furniture and accessories. 
	- Profitable idea: Create an online service that allows customers to upload photos of their rooms and get personalized color recommendations from experts or algorithms.
- Problem: Hanging artwork too high or too low. 
	- Solution: Hang artwork at eye level, which is usually around 57 inches from the floor. Use a measuring tape and a level to ensure the artwork is centered and aligned. 
	- Profitable idea: Design and sell adjustable wall mounts or hooks that can easily adjust the height and position of artwork.
- Problem: Having too much or too little lighting. 
	- Solution: Use a mix of ambient, task, and accent lighting to create different moods and functions in your space. Use dimmers, lamps, candles, and natural light to vary the intensity and direction of light.
